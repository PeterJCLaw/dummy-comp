# Dummy Compstate

This is a Dummy Competition State for the SRComp suite of tools. It serves as an
example of a relatively complete compstate, as documentation for what many of
the user-configurable keys do and as test data for many of the tools.

In general this compstate is not suitable as the basis for a fresh compstate as
it is too populated. Instead an early commit within the history of a recent
compstate is typically used.
