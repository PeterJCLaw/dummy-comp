# The layout of the teams at the competition.
# This information is used for:
# - helping the shepherds find their way around
# - setting up the first round of matches so that robot inspections,
#   which necessarily proceed geographically, occur in the same order to
#   the first rounds of matches.

# To construct the content for a new year:
# Starting top left in the layout diagram, work anti-clockwise within
# each bunch teams (they're in groups of 4 tables together),
# and either anti-clockwise around bunches of teams or left-to-right
# if they're in a line.
# While probably not entirely optimal, this should result in a fairly
# short path for someone needing to visit all teams.
